# About Me

I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University in June 2020. Before that, I was a Ph.D. candidate at [Storage Group](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) of Computer Science and Technology, [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html), and supervised by [Prof.Jiwu Shu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiwu-shu/). I received my bachelor degree at [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in China. Here is my [CV](../CV.pdf) for your reference.

My research interests include:
- **Architecture of Non-volatile Memory**
- **Security of Non-volatile Memory**
- **Non-volatile Memory based Processing-In-Memory**
- **Machine Learning Accelerator**

# News
- The journal paper, "LrGAN: A Compact and Energy Efficient PIM-based Architecture for GAN Training.", was published by Transaction of Computer (TC) in July 2020.
- I joined in the [SAFARI group at ETH Zurich](https://safari.ethz.ch/) (leaded by [Prof.Onur Mutlu](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/)) as a Post-doctor in June 2020.
