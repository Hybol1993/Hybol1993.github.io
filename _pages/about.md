Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am currently a Lecturer (i.e., Assistant Professor in the US academic system) in the [Department of Engineering](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/engineering) at [Kingâ€™s College London (KCL)](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) and an affiliated researcher with the [SAFARI Research Group](https://safari.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the SAFARI Research Group led by [Prof. Onur Mutlu](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/) at ETH Zurich. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Jiwu Shu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiwu-shu/) in the [Storage Group](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). 

I am passionate about software-hardware co-design, particularly in algorithm-architecture co-design, where I explore extensive design spaces to optimize solutions for human-centered applications, like bioinformatics that enhances life security and machine learning that advances and simplifies our daily lives.

My research interests are in the intersection between:
- Computer Architecture
- Processing-In-Memory (PIM)
- In-Storage-Processing (ISP)
- Bioinformatics
- Machine Learning
- Non-Volatile Memories (NVM)


**Openings:**
- PhD studentships available. Feel free to contact me with your CV at [haiyu.mao@kcl.ac.uk]() if you are interested in computer architecture!
