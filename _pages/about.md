Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [SAFARI Research Group](https://safari.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Onur Mutlu](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Before that, I was a Ph.D. in the [Storage Group](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html), and supervised by [Prof. Jiwu Shu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiwu-shu/). I received my bachelor degree at [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in China.

My research interests include:
- Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)
- NVM Security
- NVM-based Processing-In-Memory (PIM)
- PIM-based Machine Learning Accelerator
- PIM for Bioinformatics

Besides research, I like hiking, calligraphy, and delicious food!
